    "problem":
      "Creating and training neural networks often requires complex coding environments, making it difficult for users to track data versions, manage parallel experiments, and visualize real-time training progress.",
    "solution":
      "I built a three-tier architecture (Client, Server, and ML Engine). The system uses WebSockets for real-time communication between the .NET backend and Python ML server, allowing users to visually configure architectures, manage dataset versioning, and run multiple training sessions concurrently.",
    "outcomes": [
      "Implemented a real-time monitoring system for neural network training using Socket protocols.",
      "Developed a data management module for statistics extraction, visualization, and version control of datasets.",
      "Enabled parallel model execution and comparative analysis of results through an intuitive dashboard."

    "problem":
      "Agencies needed a reliable way to manage diverse travel packages (Cruise, Mountain, Seaside) while maintaining data integrity and the ability to undo mistakes during complex booking processes.",
    "solution":
      "Implemented an architecture using 7 design patterns: Command for undo/redo functionality, Builder for complex package creation, and a Factory/Adapter combo for seamless switching between SQLite and MySQL. Security is handled via an AES-256 encryption layer for sensitive client data.",
    "outcomes": [
      "Enabled full operational rollback through a Command history system (Undo/Redo).",
      "Achieved complete database provider independence, allowing the app to run on-premise (SQLite) or in the cloud (MySQL) without code changes.",
      "Ensured GDPR compliance by implementing transparent AES-256 encryption for passport and contact information."

    "problem":
      "Standard Linux authentication methods are sometimes insufficient for specialized security requirements, necessitating a way to inject custom logic into the system's login process without modifying the core OS source code.",
    "solution":
      "Developed a dynamically linkable library in C that adheres to the PAM API. The module handles authentication primitives and was integrated into the system's configuration (/etc/pam.d/), enabling it to intercept and validate login attempts in a live Linux environment.",
    "outcomes": [
      "Successfully extended the Linux authentication stack with a custom-built shared object library.",
      "Gained deep experience in system-level memory management and secure coding practices in C.",
      "Validated the module's stability by testing it against various system services like SSH and local login."

      "Built scalable and maintainable backend architecture for reservation management.",
      "Enabled secure user authentication and role-based access control.",
      "Improved collaboration and code quality through code reviews and structured Git workflows."
